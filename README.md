# BatteryEmuHVS
This software provides a bridge between a custom made battery and a high voltage solar inverter using the BYD HVS protocol

This project is still a work in progress so be careful !


Hardware requirements:

-Arduino board (atmega328) microcontroller.

-MCP2515 CAN-module

-MAX485 rs485-module 

-ACS712 30A current sensor (this will be updated to something more robust in the future)



tested on a Solis hybrid inverter with a 200VDC battery (18650's based)

This project is still a work in progress so be careful !
